# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a deep neural network for image classification on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

# Results

The model achieves an accuracy of around 53% on the test set.


# Requirements

In order to run the notebook, you will need to have the following packages installed:

* PyTorch
* numpy
* matplotlib
